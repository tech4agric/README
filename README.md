# Tech4Agric

Tech4Agric is an open source project whose aim is to develop a smart farming system. This includes using of various field sensors e.g temperature sensor, soil pH sensor, humidity sensor and actuators like a water pump.

## Purpose and Benefits

* The smart farming system will enable the farmer plan his/her planting in good time. This is useful in improving productivity.

* The farmer will monitor and evaluate his farm conditions on a personalised website. There, they can look at charts and graphs produced by the various sensors in the field and take action from the click of a button. This helps to reduce waste and enable management of a greater number of resources through remote sensing.

* When used, the smart farming system will help the farmer increase the quality and quantity of their yield. As a result, this will help the farmer generate more income from selling the produce and better their living standards.

You are welcomed to join us in the development of this project that will surely help others who are learning about using certain technologies for their own skills development or for their own smart farm projects.

Thank you all!
